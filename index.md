**Folk Tales versus Fairy Tales**

*Folk Tales* are stories told among the "folk" or common people of the nation. When looking back on the past, most "folk"
people were illiterate. As such, the tales were told orally from generation to generation. Men such as Charles Perrault and the Grimm brothers wrote the stories down into the versions we are most familiar with today.

**History**

*Folk and Fairy Tales* fall under the umbrella of the Traditional Narrative.
Told orally, folk tales have no known start date. Once spoken out loud, they were gone. From each teller to teller, the story could shift and change slightly. Fairy tales have start dates as someone wrote them down, and we can look back to those dates.

One can find folk and fairy tales around the world and throughout every culture. Sadly, there has been a Eurocentric focus of these tales that has permeated Western society. As such, European stories for too long have been seen as superior or as the only tales people may know. Now, people can find many tales through book collections or the internet.
