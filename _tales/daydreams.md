<p>Ivan's Master imagined that the lad was busy ploughing, but as usual he had stopped the plough and begun to dream.</p>

<p>He noticed a hare standing in the tall grass, and said to himself: 'What luck! I'll catch that hare. He should fetch a good price in the market. With the money I'll buy a young sow. Soon she will have a dozen piglets. I'll feed them all up, and they too will have litters of a dozen apiece. Then I'll slaughter the lot and sell the meat. That will bring me in enough to get married. Before long my wife will have two strong sons. I'll call them Vasha and Vanka. They will grow up and work for me. All I will have to do is sit in the porch in the sun, shouting at them. "Take it easy, boys," I'll say. "Care for those horses and they will take care of you. No need to whip them like that. It's easy to see you weren't born hard-up.""</p>

<p>Ivan waved his arms as he shouted at his sons. The hare took fright and ran off. And with the hare went Ivan's fine sons, his pretty wife, one hundred and fifty-six piglets, and one fat sow.</p>
