<p>Clarkson, A., & Cross, G. B. (1980). World Folktales. Charle’s Scribner’s Sons.</p> 

<p>World Folktales brings together a collection of sixty-six tales from around the world. They list the various countries that the tales are from, except when the story is "African," then the specific country is not provided. This lack of specificity concerning the African countries directly contrasts to the book giving the specific North American cultural group's tales. The collection includes a preface, "An Introduction to the Study of the Folktale," the stories divided into ten sections based on type (such as fairy tales, formula tales, trickster tales), with appendixes concerning folktales and the classroom, and three types of folktale indexes, and finally a selected bibliography. The stories are literary in their writing. After each story, a "Notes and Comments" section includes source and cultural notes followed by the tale type index, principle motifs, parable stories, and where to find them. The two sections involving folktales in an Elementary and a college classroom contain different activities that a teacher can implement into their lessons. The book articulates how to combine folktales with different subjects in the Elementary section, such as social studies, reading, and art. The college section gives such examples as research paper prompts and comparison paper examples. Clarkson and Cross are both folklorists and English professors.</p>
