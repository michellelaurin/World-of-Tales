<p>Haviland, V., & Schindler, S. D. (1985). Favorite Fairy Tales Told Around The World. Little, Brown.</p>

<p>In Favorite Fairy Tales Told Around The World, Haviland chose from her original Favorite Fairy Tales series (a total of sixteen books) her favorite thirty-five tales to incorporate into this collection. This collection begins with a preface from Haviland and is then divided by country. Each country contains two tales except for England, which has three. The first country given is Czechoslovakia which informs the reader that Haviland wrote this collection before it split and changed its name. However, this does not detract from the tales and may only cause readers unaware of the country's history some confusion. The tales include black and white drawings by Schinder, with the first page of the story being blocked in by a drawing of a border that reflects the story, several drawings depicting scenes, and a small drawing after the tale. At the end of the collection, there are the source notes which contain the bibliographies of the stories. The only addition to the bibliographies is for the two tales from Japan, "The Tongue-cut Sparrow" and "The White Hare and the Crocodiles." With this bibliography, Haviland quotes the preface of the sourcebook, which notes that "they have been told more with the view to interest young readers of the West than the technical student of folk-loreâ€¦"</p>
