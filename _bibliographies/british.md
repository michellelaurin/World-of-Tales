<p>Crossley-Holland, K. (1987). British Folk Tales. Orchard Books.</p>

<p>British Folk Tales contains fifty-five stories, including ghost stories, fairy stories, and heroic legends. The book contains three sections: a pronunciation guide, the stories, and then a "sources and notes" section. The stories keep some of the colloquial and cultural language, which makes the pronunciation guide helpful, but it does not have a glossary to inform the reader what those words mean if they are something other than the name of a place. The sources and notes section has the title of each story followed by where Crossley-Holland found it, the original title if he changed it, cultural notes to add depth and historical background to the story. Crossley-Holland includes tales that readers may be familiar with, such as "Goldilocks and the Three Bears," and adds tales that readers outside of Britain may have never seen before, like "The Slumber King." These tales are retellings of the versions he found and wrote as literary narratives.</p>
