<p>MacDonald, M. R. (2007). Five-Minute Tales: More Stories To Read And Tell When Time Is Short. August House Publishers.</p>

<p>Five-Minute Tales is a collection of stories that can be either read or told aloud. These tales are ones that MacDonald collected from friends and fellow tellers and ones she created. As a storyteller, the emphasis on this collection is tellable tales and written in a manner that copies speech patterns. MacDonald includes an acknowledgments page listing the people who supplied some of the stories. The collection includes an introduction, an "About the Tale Notes," which gives information about the folktale motif-indexes, notes following each tale, and an introduction to each story section. The collection has nine sections with forty-eight stories from countries and cultures worldwide, such as Basque, Brazil, the Republic of Georgia, Thailand, and Zambia. Within each story, MacDonald includes the title, where it is from, if it is a retelling by a specific person, a rough estimate of the story's telling length, source notes, added notes, and references to folktale motif-indexes. MacDonald is a professional storyteller and children’s librarian for Seattle’s King County Library, with more than sixty books published on storytelling and tales.</p>
