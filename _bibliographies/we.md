<p>Orgel, D., & Heyer, M. (2000). We Goddesses: Athena, Aphrodite, Hera. DK Publishing.</p>

<p>We Goddesses: Athena, Aphrodite, Hera is a collection of stories involving these three goddesses but told from their perspective. In her introduction, Doris Orgel gives historical background to the reader about the Greek gods and goddesses and this period. She also informs the reader why she chose to write a book focusing only on the goddesses and, in particular, these three. This collection includes a "List of Illustrations," a "Map: Where the Stories Happen," a note to the reader, an introduction, a section for each goddess with a total of fifty-six stories, an "Epilogue/Afterword," "How Artists Of Classical Times Imagined The Goddesses And Others," sources, and an index. Throughout the tales, Orgel includes added notes on the margins to define unfamiliar words, extra details, or suggestions on further reading about a particular subject.</p>
