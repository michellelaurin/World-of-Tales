<p>MacDonald, M. R. (1986). Twenty tellable tales: Audience participation folktales
for the beginning storyteller. H. W. Wilson Company.</p>
<p>In Twenty tellable tales, Margaret MacDonald brings together twenty tales for
beginning storytellers to learn. This collection also includes directions and
suggestions on how to tell the stories. At the end of each tale, there are
“Notes On Telling,” Margaret MacDonald explains how she performed the tale to
her audience or how she has seen other storytellers perform the tale. “Comparative Notes”
found at the end of many tales also share various versions of the tale and their regions
of origin. These stories are written in an ethnopoetic format to enable the beginning
storyteller to learn new tales. The stories do not have a specific order.
The collection has three parts. The first part is the tales themselves, the second
is further notes Margaret MacDonald has to enable the reader to learn storytelling
styles, and the third is a bibliography to find more sources in various formats.
This collection includes a preface, a note to the teacher of storytelling, cultural
and source notes, and further bibliographic information. The tales found within
this collection are stories the author has told throughout her career as a librarian
and storyteller in the Seattle area. They are stories that can easily translate
from the page to being shared with a storyteller’s audience. Within this collection,
the stories found are ones preschool to upper elementary-aged children would enjoy
either listening to the teller or participating in the telling.</p>
