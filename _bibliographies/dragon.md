<p>Myers, W. D., & French, F. (1972). The Dragon Takes A Wife. Scholastic.</p>

<p>The Dragon Takes A Wife is a story created by Walter Dean Myers that involves the fairy tale themes of dragons, knights, fairies, and magic. The writing style did not age well in the slang that was popular in 1972. It uses verbiage that modern readers, particularly younger Elementary-aged readers, will find confusing and detract from the story's message, self-esteem, noted in the inside flap. The story itself is delightfully charming in the silliness of magic gone awry and a dragon who cannot win a fight against a knight. Though again, this may be lost to readers as they try to understand the language used. Myers has won the Newbery Honor Award and the 1994 SLJ/YALSA Margaret A. Edwards Award for Outstanding Literature for Young Adults for his works. Fiona French's illustrations in this book are reminiscent of stained glass mixed with the bright, bold colors of the 1970s. The illustrations assist the reader in understanding what is occurring in the story. The Dragon Takes A Wife does not include any addenda.</p>
