<p>Williamson, D., & Herriot, A. B. (1986). <em>Fireside Tales Of The Traveller Children: Twelve Scottish Stories</em>. Harmony Books.</p>

<p>Duncan Williamson shares the stories he heard growing up as a traveller in <em>Fireside Tales Of The Traveller Children</em>. This collection includes twelve tales, a preface, an introduction, and a glossary. The preface is a note from Linda, Duncan's wife, which gives Duncan's life story and explains her editing process. Linda transcribed and edited this collection. The introduction is the history of travellers from 1914-1955, focusing on two aspects: "The Traveller Children's Way of Life" and "The Importance of Storytelling to the Traveller Children." There are three old black and white photographs of travellers supplied by the School of Scottish Studies in the introduction. The illustrations are black and white ink drawings with a sentence or phrase underneath from the scene. Linda transcribed the stories almost exactly as Duncan told them, with the last paragraph being who and where he heard the story and maybe a little more detail. At the end of each story, Linda adds a note that gives definitions to traveller words and phrases and life anecdotes that Duncan would use when telling the tale to his audience. There are no other addendum or source notes as these are stories that Duncan heard from other tellers and have been passed down by travellers orally for generations.</p>
