Bierhorst, J. (Ed.). (2003). Latin American Folktales: Stories From Hispanic And Indian Traditions. Pantheon Books.

Latin American Folktales: Stories From Hispanic And Indian Traditions is a collection divided into eleven sections with 127 tales spanning from "Early Colonial Legends" to "Twentieth-Century Myths." John Bierhorst is "a specialist in the language and literature of the Aztecsâ€¦and has received grants and fellowships from the Americas Society, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the National Endowment for the Arts." This collection includes many stories that have not been translated into English before, making it an essential and valuable addition to the study of Latin American folktales. Each story includes either the specific culture, state, or country this version originates. The stories are in literary form. At the end of the collection, Biehorst has a Notes section that gives further historical information, the tale type and motif numbers, and other story notes. Other addenda include a preface, an introduction, notes, a register of tale types and selected motifs, a glossary of native cultures, a bibliography, and permissions acknowledgments.
