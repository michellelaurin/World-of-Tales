de la Paz, M. J., & Tang, Y. (2014). Abadeha: the Philippine Cinderella. Shen's Books.

Abadeha: the Philippine Cinderella is a reconstruction of the original tale by Myrna J. de la Paz. De la Paz is an authority to reconstruct this tale as she was born in Manila, Philippines, and grew up in a town where people practice indigenous cultural and spiritual beliefs and Christianity. In the author’s note, de la Paz writes that the original tale had disappeared from mainstream tellings due to Spanish colonization and Americanization. De la Paz adds that they pulled from Philippine culture, local religious beliefs, and practices to add back into this version what would most likely have been present in the original tale. De la Paz does not specify the specific local beliefs and practices. The author’s note does explain the cultural significance of Abadeha’s obedience, the whip, and the title page, written in Alibata, an ancient and forgotten system of writing. Youshan Tang illustrates this story in a pastel style that honors the Philippine culture the story takes place.
