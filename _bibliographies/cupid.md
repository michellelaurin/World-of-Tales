Barth, E., & Forberg, A. (1976). Cupid and Psyche: A Love Story. Seabury Press.

Edna Barth retells the story of Cupid and Psyche, the love they have for each other, and the journey both take to learn about the relationship between love and trust. Cupid and Psyche includes an author’s note on Barth’s reasons for writing this story and its historical and allegorical significance in ancient Greece. There are no addenda added to inform the reader of the author’s research materials. The illustrations are black and white watercolor with burnt orange pillars interspersed to create blocking throughout the book.
