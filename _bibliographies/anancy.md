<p>French, F. (1991). <em>Anancy and Mr. Dry-Bone</em>. Little, Brown.</p>

<p><em>Anancy and Mr. Dry-Bone</em> is an original story by Fiona French. French based these characters on those found in “Jamaican and African folktales.” However, it does not specify what tales or countries in Africa or any cultural groups she pulled these characters from to create this story. As an original tale, it is funny and clever how Anancy borrows pieces of clothing from different animals to make Miss Louise laugh. The illustrations are a mixture of black silhouettes and bold colors to make characters stand out. However, French takes such liberties without giving any addenda concerning her sources and the specific tales that inspired her. In the back inside flap, it reads, “Fiona French read countless collections of Jamaican Anancy stories, but found them too long and complicated for a picture book…and drew Anancy’s trait of borrowing from an African folktale.” These two sentences make it appear that the culturally rich folktales from Jamaica and the African countries she pulled inspiration from are too tricky for young readers to enjoy and understand. This original story would have more merit if French included her sources and specific tales she drew inspiration from to create this new tale. French is a talented illustrator but lacks authority on Jamaican and African folktales.</p>
