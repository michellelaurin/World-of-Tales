Matsutani, M., & Iwasaki, C. (1968). The Crane Maiden. (A. Tresselt, Trans.). Parents' Magazine Press.

The Crane Maiden is the story of the title character and her relationship with an older couple. This work was originally written in Japanese by Miyoko Matsutani. Alvin Tresselt translated it into English. This translation allows an English-reading audience to discover a Japanese tale that may otherwise be unknown to them. Matsutani is an authoritative author on Japanese retellings and has written award-winning juvenile books both in Japan and in the United States. Other than on the inside front flap, there are no addenda. The inside flap gives some background about the crane and its place in Japanese folklore. Chihiro Iwasaki does the illustrations and is in the style of watercolors. The story content will appeal to all ages as the story contains elements of love, hope, and broken promises. The illustrations will capture readers' attention as it evokes a sense of wonder with its vibrant colors of the scenes depicted on each page.
