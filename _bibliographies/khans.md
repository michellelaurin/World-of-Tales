<p>Yep, L., Tseng, J., & Tseng, M-S. (1997). <em>The Khan's Daughter: A Mongolian Folktale. Scholastic</em>.</p>

<p><em>The Khan's Daughter</em> follows Möngke, a poor shepherd boy, in his quest to marry the Khan's daughter, Borte, adapted from "a story translated by Bernard Jülg and published in 1868 in Mongolische Märchen." There is a cultural note about the artwork, a glossary, and a translation of the title written in Mongolian characters. However, these notes are on the copyright page in small lettering and easy to overlook. According to the notes, the artwork was done in acrylic against a gold-leaf background and watercolor, with the ornaments "based on motifs found in Mongolian art." Yep is the author of thirty-five children's books, many of which are Asian folklore, and has won a Booklist Editor's Choice and a Notable Book in the Field of Social Studies. Jean and Mou-Sien Tseng have illustrated many of Yep's Asian folklore books, and Mr. Tseng, in particular, has used his fine arts career focusing on the Mongolian people and culture.</p>
